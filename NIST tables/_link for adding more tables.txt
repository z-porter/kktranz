If this link no longer works, a search of "NIST form factor tables" should work. There is no permalink available.

When adding tables:
select lowest and highest possible range 
	(0.01 to 500 keV)

copy-paste E and f', f'' to text file using the established naming convention:
	'(Element) fp.txt'
	'(Element) fpp.txt'
where (Element) is the 1-2 letter symbol
